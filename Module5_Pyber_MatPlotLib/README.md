# PyBer_Analysis



## Overview of the PyBer Challenge
The analysis was created for V.isualize and shows the comparison of weekly fares per city type. The analysis was created by using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The graph that was created using matplotlib shows the Total weekly fares per city type over the course of 4 months. The city types included are rural, suburban, and urban. 


## Results

### Differences in the city types

In the graph above you can see that the urban city type has the highest total weekly fare out of any city type. Drivers in urban cities have to charge low fares due to the high number of competitors in urban cities. The second highest total weekly fare is the suburban city type. In the suburbs demand for transportation is lower, but still needed. The lowest total weekly fare is in the rural city type. This is not a surprise given the rural city types smaller population.

As you can see from the image above, the rural city types total weekly fares is far lower than both urban and suburban city types. Clearly the ideal city type to be a driver in would be urban, but suburban cities would still be a fine location for a driver.

#### Urban City Types
The urban cities have 2405 drivers. The urban cities have a total of 1625 rides. The urban types have a total fare of $39854.38. In urban cities the average fare per ride is $24.53. This is likely due to the high number of drivers in urban areas and the shorter trip durations. The average fare per driver in urban cities is $16.57. The urban drivers make the least amount of money per ride, but their high amount of rides make up for the low fare. 

#### Suburban City Types
The suburban cities have 490 drivers. The suburban cities have a total of 625 rides. The suburban city types have a total fare of $19,356.33. In suburban cities the average fare per ride is $30.97. The average fare per driver in suburban cities is $39.50. The suburban drivers make the second largest amount of money per ride, but also have the second highest amount of rides. 

#### Rural City Types
Rural city types have 78 total drivers. The rural cities have a total of 125 rides. The rural city types have a total fare of $4,327.93. Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride at $34.62. This is likely due to the low supply of drivers in rural areas. The average fare per driver in rural cities is $55.49. This is the highest average fare per driver out of all city types. Overall, the rural city drivers make the most money per ride, but have the lowest amount of rides. 


## Summary
For the Urban city types, I recommend creating a ride experience that makes your drivers stand out from the competition. There is a high number of competition in urban areas, so to prevent your drivers having to price cut their fares, they should improve the customer experience. For the Suburban city type, I recommend keeping your strategy the same. For the rural city type, I recommend limiting the number of drivers to prevent competition from getting too strong and resulting in price cuts.
