## Overview
The following analysis was created for Citibike and their investors to assit them in detemining if Des Moine's, Iowah is a suitable location to expand their bikesharing business to. Using Tableau I've created several visualizations to help Citibike come to their conclusion. The main data that we will be focusing on is the current usage per gender, hour, and weekday. To make the decision process easier, I've also created a storyboard on Tableau to provide extra insight into the data.



## Results of the Analysis


### Overall Usage per Gender

- As you can see from the image above, Males make up the majority of the CitiBike users at over 1,500,000 users.


### Daily and Hourly Usage Hotspots by Gender

- In the first hotspot chart, Trips by Gender by Weekday, you can see that subscriber usage vastly outnumbers the customer usage, except for on the weekends. This may be the result of higher tourism on the weekends, as well as, an increased want for leisure biking on the weekends. 
- In the second hotspot chart, Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour), shows the level of usage each hour of each weekday. As you can see, the hours that male and females use CitiBike are very simalar. Based on the high trip counts in the morning and afternoon during the work week, we can infer that most customers are using CitiBike as a mode of transportation to and from work. 


### Checkout Times and Hourly Usage

- In almost all cases, Citibike trips don't last longer than an hour. The majority of the trips last less than 20 minutes. This is likely due to many subscribers using citibike as a means of work transportation. If Citibike were being used more for leisure, the typical trip durations would be longer.
- The Trips by Weekday Hour hostpot is showing the count of trips based on each hour for each day of the week. This shows us similar results as the previous 2 hotspot charts.

### Trips by Location

- The chart above shows the count of trips based on the starting location. As you can see, there is a big cluster of trips. This is probably due to the high population density and high tourism rates seen in this location. Additionally, this shows that CitiBike is a great alternative to driving in areas of high traffic.




## Summary
Based on the Data visualizations, I believe that Des Moines has the potential to be a successful location for Citibike to expand their business to. Citibike will offer the citizens of Des Moine's a cheaper and healthier mode of transportation. Des Moines has a much smaller population size than New York City, so CitiBike should begin by only offering their bikes in Des Moine's downtown areas with higher population counts and consumer traffic. Citibike's expanse into Des Moines should be limited and include strategically placing their bikes close to apartment buildings to increase opportunities for residence to subscribe.
