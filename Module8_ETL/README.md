# Movies_ETL

The files attached show an analysis of movie data for the use of Amazon Prime. The analysis was created using Python on Jupyter Notebook and SQL on PgAdmin. In the first deliverable file, you will see how I write a function to read three different files. In the second deliverable file, I import and alter data from the wikipedia dataset. In the third deliverable, I do the same to the Kaggle data set. In the final deliverable I connect Jupyter Notebook to PgAdmin to create a database for the movie data I've collected.
