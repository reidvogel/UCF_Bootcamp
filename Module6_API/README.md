# World Weather Analysis


## Overview
This analysis was created for the PlanMyTrip app to provide users with additional information and help regarding their travel plans. Using python code, Pandas, Matplotlib, and APIs, I was able to create an analysis for Jack, that includes the following:
  - weather descriptions to the weather data
  - a filter for weather preferences to find locations and lodging suitable for each users' preferences
  - a travel route between four cities chosen by a beta tester
  - a marker layer map
