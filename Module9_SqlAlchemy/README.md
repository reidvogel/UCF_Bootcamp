## Overview
This analysis is created for potential investors in the Surf n' Shake shop located in Oahu, Hawaii. The analysis explores weather trends in Oahu, Hawaii during the months of June and December. Using SQLAlchemy and Python code on Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook, I have processed and organized the data to show if this store could be sustainable throughout the year. The first two queries I created will show the Temperature data for June and December and will be found in the "Results" section. The second two queries, that will be found in the "Summary" section, show the percipitation data for June and December. 


## Results

#### June Temperatures

### Comparing June and December's Temperatures
- The temperature mean's for both of the months only vary a few degrees. December's mean is only 3 degrees less than June's. 
- The minumum temperature for December is 8 degrees lower than in June, which will likely result in a decline in sales during the month of December. However, The majority of the month will be warmer and still provide plenty of business to uphold the sustainability of the store. 
- As you can see, Decembers maximum temperature is only 2 degrees less than June's maximum temperature. Since there are still some high temperature days in December, I don't see temperature having a negative impact on the store's sustainability. 

## Summary


### Key Takeaways From The June and December Temperatures
The temperature differences between June and December are not significant and show promising signs for the store's sustainability year-round. December will definitely have some days that will yeild low sales, but the majority of the month should be profitable based on the temperature data. Because the maximum temperatures in June and December are surprisingly close, I believe the temperature in Oahu will create a positive impact on the store's sustainability throughout the year.

### Comparing June and December's Percipitation
- December's maximum percipitation is about 2 inches higher than June's percipitation, which will cause a decrease in consumer traffic for December. 
- December's mean for Percipitation is roughly .08 higher that June's mean.
- Surprisingly, December's percipitation count is about, 1,500 less than June's percipitation count.
- Based on the Data above, we can infer that December has fewer days that percipitation occurs than June, but December still averages a higher amount of percipitation. Percipitation will cause a negative impact on the store, but based on the data, the store should remain sustainable year-round.
