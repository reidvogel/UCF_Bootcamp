# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis



## Overview
The puprose of this analysis is to obtain the number of retiring employees for each title and determine what employees could participate in a mentorship program. To create the analysis, we have made 4 different tables on SQL. The tables created and retirement titles, unique titles, retiring titles, and mentorship eligibility. 



## Results


#### Retirement Titles
- This table shows all of the employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. This shows all of the employees that are of retirement age and what their work title is. The following picture shows how we programed the table to show the results.

#### Unique Titles
- This table shows all of the unique names and only the current title of each employee. This table was created because some employees have switched titles so they had multiple title enties within the data. Below you can see how i used code to create this table on SQL.
