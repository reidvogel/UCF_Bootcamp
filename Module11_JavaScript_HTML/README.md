# UFOs Webpage Analysis


## Overview

This project was created for Dana to improve user functionality on her website. The improvement made to her website will now allow users to filter the search for multiple criteria at the same time. Prior to this, users could only do a single criteria search based on the date of the UFO sighting. This project was created by using JavaScript and HTML on Visual Studio Code. In order to make this addition possible, I remove the search button, then add the new filters to the "Filter Search" form. The new options for filtering the search includes filters for date, city, state, country, and shape.



## Results of the UFO Analysis

### Criteria Search Process
A criteria search, like this, will prevent users from having to scroll through each and every row to find the UFO sighting(s) they are looking for. Instead, users will now be able to find specific UFO sightings with just a few clicks of a button. Below you will see how to use the search, as well as, a few examples of how the search can be used to benefit the users.

#### Filtering by Date
To filter by date, a user has to type the specific date they are looking for, such as 1/1/2010, and click enter. This will pull up all of the UFO sightings that occured on that date. The image below shows the results when the 1/1/2010 is typed into the date search.

#### Filtering by Location
Users have the option to filter their search based on location. They can do this by selecting and typing into the city, state, or country search box. A user might use a location filter to see if any UFOs have been sighted in their area. The example below shows the results of a filter based on UFO sightings that occured in Florida.

#### Filtering by Shape
Users can also filter the search based on the shape of the UFO spotted. In the example below, the data was filtered by shape, showing only the sighting where the UFO was sphere shaped.

#### Filtering by multiple criteria
As previously stated, users can now filter the search based on multiple different criteria at the same time. This will allow users to narrow their search down to a single sighting. The only difference between performing a single and multiple criteria search is that users must click and type into additional filter boxes. the image below shows an example of a multiple criteria search on the webpage using 1/1/2010 for the date, Florida (fl) as the location, and sphere as the shape criteria.

## Summary

### Future Improvement Possibilities
The new design looks great and functions well, but the data set is limited. The data could be expanded to allow users to input new UFO sightings. To ensure a modicum of authenticity, all user input data could also be approved by Dana, prior to being added onto the public dataset of UFO sightings. 

In additional way to improve the design would be to include pictures of the sightings if they are available. With this, I would be able to expand the filter search to allow users to search for data that includes pictures as well.
